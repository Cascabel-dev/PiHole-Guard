Pi-Hole Guard is a project with an extreme focus on comprehensive and effective blocking, without breaking functionality or hurting user experience.  I have personally been a Pi-Hole user for over a year now, but every time I set up my Pi-Hole on a different machine, I had a difficult time managing which lists and regex filters I had set up.  This project seeks to fix that by rolling all the best domains to block into one simple list.
