Pi-Hole Guard is a project with an extreme focus on comprehensive and effective blocking.

It will likely break some non-critical functionality in certain devices. You will not have the capability of changing wallpapers on a Roku TV with this list, for example. However, this list aims to have far and away the most comprehensive blocking of ads, trackers, and annoyances, of any other list currently available.

I have personally been a Pi-Hole user for over a year now, but every time I set up my Pi-Hole on a different machine, I had a difficult time managing which lists and regex filters I had set up. This project seeks to fix that by rolling all the best domains to block into one simple list.
